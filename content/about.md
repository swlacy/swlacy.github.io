Hi, I'm Sid. I'm a Security Engineer at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) within the Vulnerability Management space. My interests include security (duh), privacy (of course), and technology (you have just stumbled upon tech guy blog #2274716).

Jokes aside, infosec has been an interest of mine for as long as I can remember. I don't think anyone could have anticipated the extent to which society would come to depend on the internet, nor how low the barrier to entry would fall from an adversarial perspective. It's awesome and terrifying at the same time. I wrote my first piece of malicious code (proof-of-concept?) in middle school, and, well, here I am now, so clearly the fascination stuck.

I started this blog in 2021 as a university student to share personal projects. I also wanted to learn more about web development, and figured creating a website of my own would be a good way to do so. I'm currently using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as my SSG and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) as my CSS framework, with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) as my host.

While publishing my first site was fun, I feel I "outgrew" my old content in a sense, so I've decided to start fresh. I'm not sure what this blog will become, but I'm excited to find out. I saw a post online that said something to the effect of using a blog as simply a journal of thoughts, rather than a place to publish "polished" content with a strictly educational angle. I like that idea, so I'm going to try it out. I have no set goal to post at *X* frequency over *Y* time, or to write about *Z* topics in particular, but if I have a neat idea or project, I might post it here.

Outside of the industry, I also enjoy cycling, hiking (yes, I actually hike sometimes for real, this is not a Tinder bio), and I've recently started learning to play chess. Oh, and how could I forget roasting in the sun on Washington's hottest summer lake days üçπ.

I'm always happy to chat, so feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:contact@swlacy.com?subject=Hello!) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lacysw).

Thanks for reading! üòÅ
